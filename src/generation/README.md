# Generation

This task evaluates LLMs' ability to generate **Phunny-style** puns under two conditions:

- **Free:** No restrictions on subject selection. Each model generates 50 puns.  

- **Constrained:** The subject is **fixed**. Since multiple puns can be generated from the same subject and creativity varies across models, this task does not have predefined gold labels.
